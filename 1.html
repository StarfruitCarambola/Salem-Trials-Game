					You are a farmer who inherited and works the farm after your late father and mother had died. 
                    The farm is located at the center of Salem and as a result, nothing was ever too far away from you. 
                    The town square was only a couple minutes of walking and traveling to the fish market harbors in the east, 
                    the forest in the south, and the west lake was all the same distance away from you. <br/><br/>
                    
                    After your parents passed away, there is no one else at the farm except you, 
                    but you often get visitors coming back to say hello or to offer some help in return for some eggs or milk. 
                    However, lately, no one has been visiting after the trials started taking place except for your childhood friend, Lady Edea, who lives three farms south. 
                    
                    You and Edea had been friends longer than you can remember. It started back 23 years ago when Edea and her family moved into Salem after arriving at the harbor.
                    After they moved in, you and your parents came to visit their new farm to welcome them to Salem. 
                    You and Edea played all day and you kept visiting every Saturday to do so. 
					Even as an adult, where you have less time on your hands, you still try to make some time to visit her.
