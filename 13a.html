                    The judge says, "That is very cooperative of you. You are under arrest for witchcraft. 
					Guards, take this witch to the chamber and have the magistrate obtain a formal, signed confession." <br/><br/>
					
					The guards escort you down a stairway into a chamber deep underneath the courtroom. 
					They toss you in a dark and cold cell with a only a small grated window high up on the walls to allow in a bit of sunlight. 
					The cell reeks of manure and corroded dead mice. Sometimes, you can hear the screams and cries of pain outside your cell. <br/><br/>
