# Salem-Trials-Game
By Raymond Kwok

Description
-------------
Used Javascript to create a decision based game. 
Worked on it for a couple days but had to stop due to time constraints.

Downloading and setting up the game files:
-------------------------------------------
When you download the files, extract them. 
Then afterwards, there is a second zip file that says "images" instead the extracted files. 
Extract that into an "images" folder in the same directory.

Playing the Game
-----------------
To play the game, click on the HTML file that says "salemTrials."
The words in black are part of the story, and the words in red are the options you can click on.
If you want to restart back to the beginning, scroll down and click on the witch on the bottom right of the map.
