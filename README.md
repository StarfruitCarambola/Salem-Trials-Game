# Salem-Trials-Game
By Raymond Kwok

Description
-------------
Used Javascript to create a decision based game. 
Worked on it for a couple days but had to stop due to time constraints.


Playing the Game
-----------------
To play the game, click on the HTML file that says "salemTrials."
The words in black are part of the story, and the words in red are the options you can click on.
If you want to restart back to the beginning, scroll down and click on the witch on the bottom right of the map.
There are a multitude of endings so play to find them all!
