					You deny that you are a witch. You say that you have had nothing to do with witchcraft. <br/><br/>
                    
                    You said how his slaves were always screaming at you in some gibberish every time you pass by his farm, and all you did was screaming back louder to get them to shut up. 
                    You only scare them, but you did not kill them. Poldi is beating his slaves so much; it is no wonder why some of them don't want to continue living. <br/><br/>

                    If you confess you, everything will go easier on you. Now tell me, are you a witch?"
