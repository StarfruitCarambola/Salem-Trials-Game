					You enter the courthouse. You have been in this place more than you can count, but you never expected to be the one up in the front since now. 
                    In front of you was the judge, behind you was the town citizens sitting down for your trial, to your right sat the clerk, and to your left stood Poldi.
                    You question why Poldi was here as well. Maybe he was being accused of a witch as well. <br/><br/>
