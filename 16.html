                    The judge says, "So you have been conspiring with a fellow witch! I declare you guilty! Take him to the chamber." <br/><br/>
                    
                    The guards escort you down a stairway into a chamber deep underneath the courtroom. 
                    They toss you in a dark and cold cell with an only a small grated window high up on the walls to allow in a bit of sunlight. 
                    The cell reeks of manure and corroded dead mice. Sometimes, you can hear the screams and cries of pain outside your cell. <br/><br/>
