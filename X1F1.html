					The judge concludes, "In punishment thereof this court sentences you to death."  <br/><br/>
					
					The guards shave your hair and put you in a fresh woven shift. They lead you out of the courthouse and put you in a wagon. 
					Inside the wagon, there are people you know, the fat seamstress, the old baker, a brick-layer, a midwife, a lawyer. You do not talk to each other. 
					The wagon is pulled out of the town to the hill of judgment. The crowd thronging the way yells insults and curses at you. 
					You reach the hill where many fires have already raged. The smoky air reeks of burnt flesh. 
					You are pulled out of the wagon. They tie you and the others to stakes. They pile up fresh kindling at your feet.					
					They heap wood and sticks around you. Prayers are said. The fire starts, burns. The crowd cheers. You look up and smile. <br/><br/>
					
					"Looks like I'll see you soon Edea." <br/><br/>

					You suffer horribly and die. 
					They scatter your ashes in the river. <br/><br/>
