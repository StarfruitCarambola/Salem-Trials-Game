					The next day, you hear that Poldi Breschfeld has been convicted of being a witch and will be executed in the afternoon. 
                    You show up with hundreds of other people. It felt like you were rewatching Edea's execution again. 
                    Poldi arrives in a cart with several condemned witches, but this time you don't recognize any of the other convicted.    
                    The guards drag them out of the carts with their bodies beaten and injured. 
                    The convicted stand before the executioner and the magistrate reads out the same speech as he did in the previous one. <br/><br/>

					"It has been declared by law and justice that these people have been found guilty of witchcraft and many wicked deeds. 
					They have denied God, and his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and instead have turned themselves, their body and soul, into servants of Satan. 
					They are idolaters, blasphemers, heretics, and murderers. Therefore they have been condemned to death!" <br/><br/>
                    
					One by one, the executioner's ax comes crashing down, and the sound of broken bones creates shockwaves in the air only to be followed by a loud thud. <br/><br/>
