					It was a Saturday afternoon when the church bells rang. It sounds like another trial was about to take place. <br/><br/>
                    
                    The bells had lost the old sound it had before. Before, it was the sound for everyone to gather at the church on Sundays. 
                    It was the sound of friends and families coming together to pray to their lord. It was the sound of good prayers and worships. 
					However, times had changed. Now they ring for the dreaded, upcoming trial later in the day. 
                    It had been rung enough where it was hard to tell if it was Sunday anymore.
                    Now it was the sound of fear. The sound of people begging for their innocence. 
                    It was the sound of an upcoming death. <br/><br/>
                    
                    Strange events have been occurring around Salem after Abigail and some other girls went into the forest. 
                    Rumors spread around town saying they have been dancing around the fire like they were performing some form of a satanic ritual.
                    Afterward, everyone in town seemed to become more frantic and paranoid with each other. 
                    Some speculated there was a devil amidst us and Satan was pulling the strings to everything going on. 
                    No one seems to trust each other anymore. All the relationships everyone forged over their life had disappeared as if they were nothing.
                    Even the closest of friends betray and accuse each other to escape the potential punishments if proven guilty.  <br/><br/>
