					You say you confess that you are a witch. 
					Knowing that they won't believe you if you deny it and would suffer eternal pain, you decide to confess hoping they would believe you and let you go free. <br/><br/>
					                    
					The magistrate says, "Now that you have admitted to being a witch, let us be clear about what you have done in the name of Satan. 
					We must have a proper, written signed confession. Answer the following questions. The scribe will record your answers. 
					If your answers are not satisfactory, torture will be applied."
