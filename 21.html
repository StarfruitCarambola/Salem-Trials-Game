					The sound of gasps and woahs fill the crowds as you are the first person to be declared innocent. 
                    Everyone congratulates you on your trial, but you continue to walk towards the exit. <br/><br/>
                    
                    Afterwards, you begin walking back to the farm with your heart still racing from the trial. 
                    You pray in thanks to God, for he has delivered you the divine protection from being accused as a witch.
                    But most of all, you thank Edea for watching over you and making sure you didn't suffer the same fate she did.<br/><br/>
