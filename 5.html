                    A magistrate reads out a speech to the crowd. <br/><br/>
                    
                    "It has been declared by law and justice that these people have been found guilty of witchcraft and many wicked deeds. 
                    They have denied God, and his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and instead have turned themselves, their body and soul, into servants of Satan. 
                    They are idolaters, blasphemers, heretics, and murderers. Therefore they have been condemned to death!" <br/><br/>
                    
                    Each of the accused rests their heads on a block of wood. 
                    With every swing of the executioner's ax, the sound of broken bones echoes across the town square and the smell of blood splatter in the air.
                    As each one got executed, you can hear the roar of the crowd cheering as each witch falls.<br/><br/>
					
					When it was Edea's turn, you wanted to call out her name, but your mouth froze shutting knowing that you shouting out her name would lead you to your demise as well. 
                    Edea sees you in the crowd and gives off a quick smile before the ax swings. You look away, and no matter how tight your eyes are shut, tears still leaked out. <br/><br/>
