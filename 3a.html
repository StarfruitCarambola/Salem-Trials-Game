					You decide to attend Edea's trial to hope she can be proven innocent<br/><br/>
                    
                    You arrive at the courtroom taking the front seat hoping to see her up close. 
                    There she was, standing in front of the judge all alone with no one to back her up along with the man accusing her as a witch. <br/><br/>
                    The trial started. Edea pleaded to the judge on how she is innocent, but every one of her statements got retorted by that man. 
                    Every reason Edea gave, the man always connected it to her being a witch. No matter how much you wanted to step in, you couldn't and sat there helplessly.  
                    After a brutal hour of debate, the judge ended and muttered the word you hoped you didn't hear. <br/><br/>
					
					"Guilty!" <br/><br/>
