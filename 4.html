					You and everyone else gathered at the town square where they hold their executions. <br/><br/>
                    
                    You blend into the crowd as you wait. After an hour of waiting, you see the officials carry a cart with several people locked up inside.
                    All of them had their heads shaved, their bodies bruised, and their souls broken.
                    As you peer past over the crowd's heads, your eyes begin to wander to where Edea is. <br/><br/>

                    One by one they exited out the cart with their arms tied beyond their backs with guards next to them. 
                    You recognize some people as they come out: the miller's 14-year old daughter, 68-year old Gerlinde Altweib, and the fisherman that often fishes by the west lake. 
                    As more and more come out, Edea is nowhere to be seen. When they stopped coming out, you dream of seeing and talking to Edea one more time. 
                    However, that didn't last long. The guards called out the last person to come out of the cart. It was Edea.  <br/><br/>
